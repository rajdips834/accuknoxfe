# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with **HMR (Hot Module Replacement)** and some **ESLint rules**.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-react) â€” uses **Babel** for Fast Refresh  
- [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) â€” uses **SWC** for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a **production application**, we recommend using **TypeScript** with type-aware lint rules enabled.  
Check out the [TypeScript template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) for information on how to integrate `typescript-eslint` in your project.
